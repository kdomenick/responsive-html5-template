				<div class="box pad grey">
					<h4>The Four Column Layout divides content into four equal quarters.</h4>
					<p>The Four Column layout is good for galleries or any page that needs to display lists of links or buttons, especially
					graphical links.</p>
					<p>Four Columns can be useful for Home or landing-type pages where several options need to be
					displayed as a sort of sub-navigation area.</p>
					<p>
					NOTE: Four columns behave differently than other column layouts since they scale to 50% (column halves) at screen sizes of 48em,
					and then 100% at 25em.
