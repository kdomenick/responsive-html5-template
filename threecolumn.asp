				<div class="box pad grey">
					<h4>The Three Column layout divides content into three equal thirds.</h4>
					<p>The Three Column layout is good for galleries or any page that needs to display lists of links or buttons, especially
					graphical links. </p>
					<p>Three columns can be useful for Home or landing-type pages where several options need to be
					displayed as a sort of sub-navigation area. <span class="bold">The <a href="home.htm"> Home</a> page of this project uses the Three Column layout.</span></p>
					<p>The Three Column layout can also be inserted into the middle of form to show form elements in an inline
					display on larger screens.</p>
					<p>
					NOTE: columns only apply to normal to wider screen sizes, since columns scale to 100%
					once the screen size drops to 48em.
