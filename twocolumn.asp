				<div class="box pad grey">
					<h4>The Two Column layout divides content into two equal halves.</h4>
					<p>Two Column layout is good for any page that needs to be divided in half.</p>
					<p>The two column layout can also be inserted into the middle of a form to show the form's elements in an inline
					display on larger screens.</p>
					<p>A single column-half div can be used to wrap all of the content in a page, keeping
					the content contained in the left half of a page.  This is useful when there isn't a lot
					of content and it's visually cleaner than stretching that content the width of the screen.</p>
					<p>
					NOTE: columns only apply to normal to wider screen sizes, since columns scale to 100%
					once the screen size drops to 48em.
